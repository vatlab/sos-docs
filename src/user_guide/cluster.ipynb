A limitation of starting workers on remote servers is that the remote servers must share the same file systems as the local host so this approach only works for workstations with auto-mount home directories, or computing nodes of cluster systems."

    "An obvious problem with the use of option `-j` to start workers on multiple computing nodes of a cluster system is that the computing resources (nodes) are allocated dynamically by the scheduler so it is difficult to know in advance which computing nodes will be assigned. Because cluster systems usually specify nodes used by a particular job with environment variables (e.g. `PBS_NODEFILE` for a PBS system, and `LSB_MCPU_HOSTS` for a LSF system), SoS addresses this problem by automatically translate node information from these variables to option `-j` if a supported cluster environment is detected. Therefore, a typical way to execute a large workflow on multiple nodes would be the creation of a wrapper script as follows:"
